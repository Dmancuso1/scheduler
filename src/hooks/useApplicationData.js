Create a new file hooks/useApplicationData.js and move the logic used to manage the state from the components/Application.js into it.

Our useApplicationData Hook will return an object with four keys.

The state object will maintain the same structure.
The setDay action can be used to set the current day.
The bookInterview action makes an HTTP request and updates the local state.
The cancelInterview action makes an HTTP request and updates the local state.
